/*
Logic:
(x+y)%2=0 it means sum of x and y must be even.
so, when sum of two number even??
when both x and y either odd or even then sum of both will come even else come odd.
find last digit of given number and store it in some variable
then, find last digit one by one of remaining number and check if first last and now last
digit both even or odd then condition satisfy and print YES else No.
